However, many models such as random forests and neural networks are black boxes where users are not able to fully understand the reasons behind a model's predictions! This becomes a problem since we …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Audrey Chan</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2019 11:47:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:audreymychan.github.io,2019-10-10:/blog/lime.html</guid><category>lime</category><category>NLP</category></item><item><title>Smile Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks</title><link>https://audreymychan.github.io/blog/dadjokesforsmiles.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Smile detection applications are countless from activating a camera shutter automatically, enhancing human-robot interaction, to being incorporated into assistive communication devices for people with disabilities. Using deep learning convolutional neural network algorithms, a smile detection algorithm with an accuracy of 89% was achieved!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The architecture of a CNN can be thought to be similar to that …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Audrey Chan</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2019 16:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:audreymychan.github.io,2019-05-31:/blog/cnn.html</guid><category>CNN</category></item><item><title>How to Handle Unbalanced Classes with imbalanced-learn</title><link>https://audreymychan.github.io/blog/unbalancedclasses.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;In machine learning, working with unbalanced classes can be challenging. Unbalanced classes occurs when there's an unequal representation of classes, where the minority class is often of higher interest to us. This is prominent in areas where data collection of the minority classes is difficult due to time and cost …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Audrey Chan</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 15 Apr 2019 23:40:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:audreymychan.github.io,2019-04-15:/blog/unbalancedclasses.html</guid><category>imblearn</category></item><item><title>你好世界!
